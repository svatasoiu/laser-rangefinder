To calibrate:
Get list of distance/offset values
fit a linear model to distance vs. 1/offset
calculate coefficients

Next Step: make calibration tool

1) Have the user move the cardboard to a certain distance
2) Have user input the distance to shell
3) Press enter and calculate offset of laser from center
4) Repeat (1)-(3) for at least 8 or so distances
5) Fit a model to distance vs. 1/offset
